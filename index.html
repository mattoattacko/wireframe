                        In your world you can create anything you desire. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Have fun with it. Let's get crazy. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You can create
                    beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into
                    town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. We artists are a different
                    breed of people. We're a happy bunch. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Pretend you're
                    water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few.
                    You'll see. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. They say everything
                    looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. All kinds of happy little
                    splashes. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just pretend you are a whisper
                    floating across a mountain. Anyone can paint. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Each highlight must have it's own private
                    shadow. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.
                    A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. I like to beat the brush.
                    Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world;
                    you become a tiger. You have to make these big decisions. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're
                    doing, you just let it happen. Very easy to work these to death. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them
                    out. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa'
                    with a two-inch brush. It's cold, but it's beautiful.
